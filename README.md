# Fake-News-Detection-System

In an age where the internet is frequently the main source of information, news audiences are at higher risk than ever of encountering and sharing fake news. Every day, consumers all over the world read, watch, or listen to the news for updates on everything from their favourite celebrity to their preferred political candidate, and often take for granted that what they find is truthful and reliable. For many audiences, navigating the news media landscape is harder than ever before and has even led to consumers around the globe avoiding the news altogether.

Identifying fake news is made more difficult by the fact that it is rapidly becoming an industry of its own, with individuals paid to write sensationalist stories and create clickbait content to increase site traffic. Disinformation, fiction masquerading as fact, and deliberate lies can be made to look legitimate and can easily reach thousands of users in a matter of minutes.

After finding out such facts, I decided to make a fake news detector system. This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, I build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
